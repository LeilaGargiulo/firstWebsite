<H1>My Hobbies</H1>
<p></p>
<p>As someone who actually loves learning, my hobbies include coding in Python, which is actually harder for me than learning HTML and CSS like I am now. Things also enjoy, swimming, a definite yes, its very peaceful for me as someone who also plays basketball. I enjoy sports and love learning about the universe. The universe is quite interesting. Did you know that even though there are more planets than stars in the galaxy? Or that even though Mercury is the closest planet to our son, Venus is still a warmer planet because of the carbon dioxide on its surface? There are many things that interest me about these awesome planets.

<p>As you proboubly already know from the Home page, I absolutely love riddles and logic questions so I will be gradually be putting them wherever I please.

<p> Question: The director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners, who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers. The director randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer. The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any order. The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds their number in one of the drawers, all prisoners are pardoned. If even one prisoner does not find their number, all prisoners die. Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may discuss strategy â€” but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters to look in the drawers. What is the prisoners' best strategy?

<p>I'll give you time to think through it.</p>
