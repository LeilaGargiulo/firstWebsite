    <h4>A Story</h4>
    <p>If you know me, you know that I am obsessed with riddles and puzzles and love solving things that nobody else seems to be able too. For example, Google gives a list of logic puzzles to their interviewie and one of them stumped me for a while but I finally found out the awnser.
        The Question:
        Pinoccio always lies. Pinnoccio says all his hats are green. What can we conclude about the above two statements?
        A: pinoccio has at least one hat
        B: pinnocio has only one green hat
        C: pinoccio has no hats
        D: pinnocio has at least one green hat
        C: pinnocio has no green hats
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>The Awnser</h4>
    <p>Imagine Pinocchio has 2 blue hats.</p> 
        He could lie to say he has all green hats. Thus answer (D) is not correct.
        <p>If Pinocchio has 1 green hat and 1 blue hat he would be lying to say he has all green hats. Thus (E) is also wrong</p>
       <p>A statement is vacuously true if the premise is false or cannot be achieved. For example, consider a room with no mobile phones. If someone says, “All mobile phones in the room are turned OFF,” then that would technically be 
        a true statement. After all, there are no mobile phones in the room, so one could say all of the ones in the room are turned off. But for the same reason, one could also speak a vacuously true statement, “All mobile phones in the room are turned ON.”
        Both statements are technically true, but they are meaningless because there are actually no mobile phones in the room.</p>
        
        Let’s apply the principle to the Pinocchio problem.
        
        (C) Pinocchio has no hats.
        
        If Pinocchio has no hats, then any statement he makes about the hats is vacuously true. Thus the statement, “All my hats are green” is technically a true statement. But we know Pinocchio always lies, so this is an impossibility.
        
        Therefore, Pinocchio cannot have no hats; he must have at least one hat. We can eliminate answer choice (C) and the only correct answer is (A) Pinocchio has at least one hat.</p>
