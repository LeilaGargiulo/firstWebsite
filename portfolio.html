    <h1>My Life and Credentials</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>Im a certified student at Tuckahoes High School in NY and am highly decorated with seven awards for best in class for all of my subjects except Spanish where I got second in class
    </p>
    <p>Born and raised in New York, I am very Italian and very German. I have aspirations, that I hope will come true, to maybe work in either cyber security, or even become an inventor or engineer for the future so coding is quite nessisary for these types of work
    </p>
    <p>I have a wonderful family, of which most are highly intellegant and most have gone ivy league. One of my cousins is very proficient in most coding languages and works for his father, my uncles, company and is about to release a new software update to the companies website and database. I am very driven to succeed and achieve my dreams like most of my family has. Good grades and amazing test scores may seem small, but to me, my family, and the school system, these small things can mean achieving your dreams or not.</p>
