    <h1>My Life and Credentials</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>Im a certified student at Tuckahoes High School in NY and am highly decorated with seven awards for best in class for all of my subjects except Spanish where I got second in class
    </p>
    <p>Born and raised in New York, I am very Italian and very German. I have aspirations, that I hope will come true, to maybe work in either cyber security, or even become an inventor or engineer for the future so coding is quite nessisary for these types of work
    </p>
    <p>I have a wonderful family, of which most are highly intellegant and most have gone ivy league. One of my cousins is very proficient in most coding languages and works for his father, my uncles, company and is about to release a new software update to the companies website and database. I am very driven to succeed and achieve my dreams like most of my family has. Good grades and amazing test scores may seem small, but to me, my family, and the school system, these small things can mean achieving your dreams or not.</p>
    <p>Sadly, I have not yet completed any projects this year quite yet, so revealing my acomplishments in words will have to do.</p>
    <p>I was and still am on National Honors Society and this summer will be taking courses like pre-calc and even courses associated with engineering at collages. I also do quite a lot of community service and have continued to help out my community at cook-outs, poetry meets, and even made cotton candy and popcorn for Tuckahoe Villages Movie Night.</p>

    <h4>Question:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>A cat is hiding in one of five boxes that are lined up in a row.</p>
        <p>The boxes are numbered 1 to 5.</p>
        <p>Each night the cat hides in an adjacent box, exactly one number away.</p>
        <p>Each morning you can open a single box to try to find the cat.<p>
        <p>Can you win this game of hide and seek? What is your strategy for finding the cat?</p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Solution:</h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>The cat’s movements are limited. A cat in box 1 has to move to box 2 the next day; a cat in box 5 has to move to box 4 the next day. Furthermore, the box number the cat occupies alternates between even and odd numbers.

            We first devise a strategy to catch a cat that starts in an even numbered box. Then we can apply that strategy again, which will catch a cat that started in an odd numbered box.
            
            Here is a strategy that will work for sure. Inspect box 2, then box 3, then box 4. If you have not found the cat, then repeat: inspect 2, 3, then 4. You will certainly find the cat by the 6th time you check.
            
            Why is that?
            
            Let’s assume the cat starts in an even box, 2 or 4.
            
            <p>Day 1: you check box 2. If the cat is in 2, you find the cat. Otherwise, the cat must be in box 4.</p>
            
            <p>Day 2: you check box 3. You will catch the cat if it moved from 4 to 3. But you will miss it if the cat moved from 4 to 5.</p>
            
            <p>Day 3: you check box 4. As the cat was previously in 5, it must have moved to 4. So you will catch the cat.</p>
            
           <p>The above strategy works if the cat started in an even numbered box. But the cat might have been in an odd numbered box 1, 3, or 5.
            
            In that case, after 3 days of checking, you know the cat is now in an even numbered box. If the cat started in 1, 3, or 5, then on night 1 the cat would move to an even box (2 or 4); on night 2 the cat would move to an odd box (1, 3, or 5); and on night 3 the cat would move to an even box (2 or 4).
            
            Thus, on the morning of day 4, you know the cat is in an even numbered box. So now you can repeat the strategy outlined above: check the boxes 2, 3, 4. You will find the cat for sure!</p>
